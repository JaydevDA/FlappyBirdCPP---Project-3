## *Game Overview* ðŸŽ®

This is a console-based clone of the classic mobile game Flappy Bird, built using C++ and Windows console functions. It simulates the original gameâ€™s basic mechanics: a bird flying through gaps between pipes, with increasing difficulty and score tracking.

### ObjectiveðŸŽ¯

- Control a bird (represented with ASCII characters).
- Avoid crashing into pipes.
- Earn points(+1) by successfully passing through pipe gaps.
- Game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground.

### DisplayðŸ’»

- When the program initiates, it displays the title of the game along with 3 options, in which you have to choose one --> start, instructions or quit.
